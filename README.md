# agol-python-scripts

Python utilities for ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Pro. The scripts at the root
are self-contained single files with nothing to install; larger tools that
need more than one file live in their own folder.

| Script | What it does | Runs with |
|---|---|---|
| `assign_polygon_colors.py` | Assigns a `colorID` to polygons so no two adjacent polygons share a value (greedy graph coloring over a Polygon Neighbors table) — for cartography where touching parcels or zones need distinct fills. Set the two path variables at the top before running. | ArcGIS Pro's Python (`arcpy`) |
| `add_badelf_fields_to_agol.py` | Adds the Bad Elf Flex (2025) GNSS metadata fields and coded-value domains to a hosted feature layer, so surveyed points keep correction type, geoid model, antenna height, and final heights. Idempotent — existing fields are skipped. | ArcGIS API for Python (`arcgis`) |
| `sketch_layer_to_template_schema.py` | Rebuilds an ArcGIS Online Map Viewer sketch layer as a feature class carrying a production dataset's full schema — fields, domains, subtypes, GlobalIDs and attribute rules — reprojecting with an explicit datum transformation and loading with rules disabled. Set the paths at the top and run once with `DRY_RUN = True`. | ArcGIS Pro's Python (`arcpy`) |
| [`canopy-toolbox/`](canopy-toolbox/) | ArcGIS Pro Python toolbox (`CanopyTools.pyt`) turning a classified lidar point cloud into canopy cover and an individual-tree layer — vegetation-only CHM, height-banded treetop detection, watershed crown delineation, zonal cover rollup. Five tools; see its own README for accuracy caveats. | ArcGIS Pro Advanced + 3D and Spatial Analyst |

## Environment

For `add_badelf_fields_to_agol.py`, any Python ≥ 3.10 with `arcgis` — for
example the `arcgis-online` pixi environment (`pixi shell` in its folder), or
`pip install arcgis`.

## Usage

```bash
python add_badelf_fields_to_agol.py --url https://myorg.maps.arcgis.com --item <item-id> --username <user>
```

The password is prompted for. Use `--layer N` when the item has more than one
sublayer. `--password` exists for automation only — prefer the prompt so the
password never lands in shell history.

## Folders

`canopy-toolbox/` is a multi-file ArcGIS Pro toolbox rather than a script.
Its band and tiling logic is deliberately free of `arcpy` so it can be
unit-tested off a Pro machine:

```bash
cd canopy-toolbox && python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
```

## History

Started as `colorID.py` (the polygon coloring script alone); renamed
2026-09-07 when the Bad Elf script joined it. The sketch layer script was
added 2026-09-11, and `canopy-toolbox/` on 2026-09-12 — the first entry
that is a folder rather than a single script.
